Air Quality Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)

This Excel dashboard analyzes air quality data across Indian cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru) using a Kaggle dataset covering 2015–2020.

 Objective
To explore pollutant trends (PM2.5, NO, CO, SO2, AQI) using Excel tools like pivot tables, charts, and data cleaning techniques. 

the goal of this project is to:
The dataset contains pollutant measurements such as PM10,PM2.5,NO2,CO,SO2,O3 and AQI across multiple cities and dates.

 Tools Used
- Excel (Data Cleaning)
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts
- Dashboard Design
- Data Visualization
- Slicers and Filters

Project Workflow
1. Imported raw dataset from Kaggle  
2. Cleaned missing values  
3. Created pivot tables for pollutant-wise city comparison  
4. Built slicers for city/parameter filters  
5. Designed a professional dashboard  
6. Derived insights from AQI trends

 Data Cleaning Steps
- Replaced missing values with *0* (in cleaned sheet only)  
- Standardized city names and date formats  
- Removed inconsistent rows  
- Separated raw and cleaned datasets for transparency  
- Validated ranges for each pollutant  

 Dashboard Features
The Excel dashboard includes:

City-wise Average Pollution Levels 
Bar charts showing PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and other pollutant averages for each city.

AQI Category Distribution
Donut/ Pie chart showing the count of days categorized as  
Good, Satisfactory, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe.

Top Polluted Cities  
Using pivot sorting and filters.

Interactive Slicers 
- Select city  
- Select pollutant  
- Choose date range  

Trend Charts  
Line charts for year-wise AQI and PM2.5 trends.

 Key Insights
- *Delhi* consistently has the highest AQI and PM2.5 levels.  
- *Bengaluru* maintains relatively better air quality.  
- Across all cities, most days fall into the *Moderate* AQI category.  
- Pollution peaks during *winter months* due to atmospheric conditions.
