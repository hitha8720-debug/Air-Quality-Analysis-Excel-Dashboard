Air Quality Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)

This project analyzes air quality data for the cities Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru using a dataset from Kaggle (2015–2020). 
Pivot tables and charts were used to compare pollutants such as PM2.5, NO, CO, SO2 and AQI.

1. Key Work Completed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing in Excel
- Handling missing values
- Creating pivot tables for pollutant comparison
- Using pivot charts and slicers
